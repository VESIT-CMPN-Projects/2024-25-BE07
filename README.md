# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Railways

This project, titled **"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Railways,"** explores the application of RAG technology to enhance railway information systems, specifically for **Konkan Railways**.

RAG combines information retrieval techniques with large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses to natural language queries. This project addresses the limitations of traditional railway apps, which often require users to manually navigate complex menus and schedules.

By leveraging **natural language processing (NLP)**, users can interact with the system conversationally and receive **real-time train schedules** and **route information**.

The system is built using:
- An external knowledge base of railway data.
- Vectorization through NLP techniques for efficient search and retrieval.

The augmented data then powers the LLM to generate **precise responses**.

### Technological and Social Relevance

- Provides a **user-friendly interface** for regular commuters and tourists.
- Promotes **seamless travel experiences**.
- Advances the integration of **AI** into public transportation systems.
